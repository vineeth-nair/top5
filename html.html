         <p class="description">The film opens with on stage skit as part of a spectacle by Ved (Ranbir Kapoor) and Tara (Deepika Padukone). The skit presents monotonous office life of people in general and their past (which will be shown as flashback sequences). The film switches to flashback and shows, Ved as a child in Shimla, who is fascinated by the stories narrated by a road side story teller (Piyush Mishra) who keeps mixing up his characters.

            The film moves to a time where Tara meets adult Ved, while both are holidaying in Corsica. They come up with an amusing verbal pact to keep their real identities undisclosed. They explore the island together. They pretend to be "Don" and "Mona Darling" and talk in filmy dialogues. When she realizes she is falling in love with Ved, Tara decides to leave Corsica despite the romantic friendship with him. The story flashes back to young Ved who questions the story-teller about the reason for happy times ending quickly and notices each story has a sad episode in it.</p>

         <p class="description">The three men learn of the Running of the Bulls in Pamplona, which is Imran's choice, baffling Kabir and Arjun. Imran contacts Laila, who joins them. When confronted by his friends, Kabir admits to the others that he is not yet ready for marriage, and that Natasha had mistaken a ring he had bought as a birthday present for his mother as an engagement ring for herself. On the morning of the bull run, Imran suggests they make a promise if they survive the event: Imran vows to publish the poetry he has written in his diary, Arjun vows to go to Morocco with Laila, and Kabir promises to tell Natasha he does not want to marry her. As they complete the event, the friends gain a renewed sense of their relationships with each other, their families and friends, and themselves.

            During the credits, Imran, Kabir, Nuria, and Natasha are shown at the wedding of Arjun and Laila in Morocco. Natasha has a new boyfriend, Kabir and Natasha are still friends, and Imran has published his poems.</p>

         <p class="description">A flashback reveals the story of Jordan, whose real name is Janardhan Jhakar a.k.a. JJ, a boy from Delhi. He is studying at Law Faculty, Delhi University and dreams of being a rockstar like Jim Morrison, for which he is often laughed at by his friends and classmates. Khatana, the canteen owner, tells JJ that one thing common among all artists is a life-altering heartbreak. JJ jokingly tells himself that since that hasn't happened yet, he won't be able to reach his idol had attained. JJ sees a beautiful girl rehearsing before a dancing contest called "Shut Up & Dance" when he and his friends go to the venue, as the contest is about to start. He watches the performance of Heer Kaul, a girl from St. Stephen's College, and overhears that she is the "perfect heartbreaking machine". He remembers the word of Khatana telling him that heartbreak is the way to become an artist, and decides to propose to Heer, but he suffers humiliation, which he sees as the perfect method for receiving the heart-break needed to achieve stardom. Over time, JJ and Heer become good friends, often going on adventures together and sometimes engaging in behaviour which the conservative JJ thinks is risky.</p>

                <p class="description">Naina Talwar (Deepika Padukone) is a shy and nerdy medical student. She studies constantly and always tops her classes, but she feels like an outcast due to her introverted nature. An encounter with an old classmate, Aditi Mehra (Kalki Koechlin), makes her realize that she wants more from life than high marks. Thus, she makes an impulsive decision to follow Aditi on a hiking trip into the Himalayas, up to Manali without informing her overbearing parents. During the hike, she renews her friendship with other former classmates, Kabir "Bunny" Thapar (Ranbir Kapoor) and Avinash "Avi" Arora (Aditya Roy Kapur). Bunny is a handsome charmer whose dream is to wander and discover the world. He does not plan to marry or settle down. He lives with his supportive father (Farooq Sheikh) who he loves very much, and his step-mother. During their trip, seeing Aditi's silent reactions to Avi's constant flirting with other girls, Bunny and Naina realize that she is secretly in love with Avi, but does not bring the matter to surface.</p>
